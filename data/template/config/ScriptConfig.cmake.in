# \file  ScriptConfig.cmake
# \brief Default script configuration.
#
# \note The file ScriptConfig.cmake.in is configured and used by BASIS to
#       generate CMake build scripts used to "build" script files.
#
# This CMake file defines CMake variables which can be used within scripts.
# If the project structure differs for the build tree and the install tree,
# the CMake variables used within the script can be set depending on the
# value of the variable BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT. This variable evaluates to true,
# when the script is build, i.e., configured, for the installation tree and
# to false, otherwise.
#
# Example:
# \code
# if (BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT)
#   set (BIN_DIR "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/bin")
# else ()
#   set (BIN_DIR "@RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY@")
# endif ()
# \endcode
#
# Avoid the use of absolute paths, however! Instead, use the variable
# @SCRIPT_DIR@ which is set to the directory of the script file to make these
# paths relative to the directory of the script file (possibly resolving
# symbolic links). The relative paths determined by the script configuration
# script shall be used in the script. Therefore, the script has to determine
# its directory at runtime. This can usually easily be done by extracting the
# path component from the first argument (and following symbolic links).
# To ease this task, the default script configuration provides function
# definitions for commonly used scripting languages.
#
# Example:
# \code
# #! /usr/bin/env bash
# @BASH_FUNCTION_getProgDir@
# progDir=$(getProgDir)
# etcDir=$progDir/@ETC_DIR@
# \endcode
#
# where ETC_DIR is the relative path determined during the configuration of
# the script. See documentation of basis_set_script_path_definition () for a
# convenience function which can be used to set the CMake variable ETC_DIR.
# This function generates the definition of a function which is prepended to
# this script configuration. Use this function as follows within this file.
#
# Example:
# \code
# basis_set_script_path (ETC_DIR "@PROJECT_ETC_DIR@" "@INSTALL_ETC_DIR@")
# \endcode
