Installation
============

An exhaustive list of minimum build dependencies, including the build tools
along detailed step-by-step build, test, and installation instructions can
be found in the `BASIS how-to guide on software installation`_.

Please refer to this guide first if you are uncertain about the steps
summarized here or if you have problems to build, test, or install the software
on your system. If this guide does not help you to resolve the issue, please
contact us at ``sbia-software at uphs.upenn.edu``.


Prerequisites
=============

.. The tabularcolumns directive is required to help with formatting the table properly
   in case of LaTeX (PDF) output.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{3.75cm}|m{1.5cm}|p{9.8cm}|

Configure
=========

1. Extract source files::

    tar -xzf <project_l>-1.0.0-source.tar.gz

2. Create build directory::

    mkdir <project_l>-1.0.0-build

3. Change to build directory::

    cd <project_l>-1.0.0-build

4. Run CMake to configure the build tree::

    ccmake -DBASIS_DIR:PATH=/path/to/basis ../<project_l>-1.0.0-source

   - Press ``c`` to configure the build system and ``e`` to ignore warnings.
   - Set ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` and other CMake variables and options.
   - Continue pressing ``c`` until the option ``g`` is available.
   - Then press ``g`` to generate the configuration files for the selected
     build tool.


Build
=====

After the configuration of the build tree, the software can be build using `GNU Make`_::

    make


Test
====

After the build of the software, optionally run the tests using the command::

    make test

In case of failing tests, re-run the tests, but this time by executing CTest_
directly with the ``-V`` option to enable verbose output and redirect the output
to a text file:

.. code-block:: bash

    ctest -V >& <project_l>-test.log

And send the file ``<project_l>-test.log`` as attachment of the issue report to
``sbia-software at uphs.upenn.edu``.


Install
=======

The final installation copies the built files and additional data and documentation
files to the installation directory specified using the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``
option during the configuration of the build tree::

    make install
    
After the successful installation, the build directory can be removed again.
