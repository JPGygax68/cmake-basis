# \file  ScriptConfig.cmake.in
# \brief Default script configuration file.
#
# This CMake file defines CMake variables which can be used within scripts.
# If the project structure differs for the build tree and the install tree,
# the CMake variables used within the script can be set depending on the
# value of the variable BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT. This variable evaluates to true,
# when the script is build, i.e., configured, for the installation tree and
# to false, otherwise.
#
# Example:
#
# \code
# if (BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT)
#   set (PROJECT_BIN_DIR "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@INSTALL_BIN_DIR@")
# else ()
#   set (PROJECT_BIN_DIR "@RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY@")
# endif ()
# \endcode
#
# \attention Avoid the use of absolute paths! If you want to refer to data
#            files, for example, consider the combination of an environment
#            variable pointing to the project root dir and a relative path set
#            in this file. Note that the environment variable needs to be read
#            by the script and the path then appended by the relative path.
#
# Example:
#
# \code
# #! /usr/bin/env bash
#
# # in the following, PROJECT_DIR is an environment variable which has to be
# # set by the user on their system; the variable PROJECT_DATA_DIR, on the
# # other side, is set by the project's script configuration relative to the
# # project root directory.
# dataPath="${PROJECT_DIR}/@PROJECT_DATA_DIR@"
# \endcode
#
# Directories should be given relative to the project root directory which is
# either the root of the build tree or the root of the install tree. Note that
# many CMake variables are set to absolute paths. Hence, these paths have to be
# converted to relative paths in order to guarantee consistency between paths
# used for the build tree script and those of the install tree script.
#
# Example:
#
# \code
# if (BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT)
#   set (PROJECT_BIN_DIR "@INSTALL_BIN_DIR@")
# else ()
#   set (PROJECT_BIN_DIR "@RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY@")
#   file (RELATIVE_PATH PROJECT_BIN_DIR "@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR@" "${PROJECT_BIN_DIR}")
# endif ()
# \endcode
