INTRODUCTION

  Introduce your software package here and describe its purpose. This section
  is very similar to an abstract of a scientific article. The focus here is,
  however, on the software, not the methodology.


PACKAGE OVERVIEW

  In the following, a summary of the top-level files and folders is given. This
  summary provides an overview of the software package. Items which are only
  part of the source distribution package are marked by (src), while items which
  are only part of a binary distribution package or installation, respectively,
  are marked by (bin).

  Files:

  - AUTHORS           : A list of the people who contributed to this software
                        package in chronic order.
  - INSTALL           : Contains build and installation instructions (src).
  - LICENSE           : The license under which this project is distributed.
                        See this file for details regarding licensing.
  - README            : This readme file (src).
  - CMakeLists.txt    : The root CMakeLists.txt file of this CMake-based project (src).
  - CTestConfig.cmake : The configuration file for CTest (src).

  Folders:

  - bin     : Contains all the binary executables and shared libraries (bin).
  - config  : Project configuration files based on CMake are located in this folder (src).
  - data    : Auxiliary data required by the executables is located in this folder.
              If no auxiliary data is needed, this folder is omitted.
  - doc     : Further documentation such as the User Manual can be found here.
  - example : Example data and implementations using the provided libraries (if any)
              can be found in this directory tree. The User Manual demonstrates
              a use case of this software package based on this example data.
  - include : If the package provides binary libraries for use in other projects,
              the required public source header files can be found in this folder (bin).
  - lib     : Static (and import libraries on Windows systems) are installed here (bin).
  - src     : This folder contains all source files from which the binary executables
              and libraries are built. Some of the source files are further written
              in scripting languages such as BASH, Python, and Perl (src).
  - test    : Additional data which is required for testing the software is
              located in this folder. Moreover, the implementation of the tests
              can also be found here (src).
