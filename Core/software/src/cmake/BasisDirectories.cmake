# \note This variable was just recently introduced in CMake, it is derived
#       here from the already earlier added variable CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
#       to maintain compatibility with older CMake versions.

# source tree
# ============================================================================

# The directories of the source tree are given here relative to the root
# directory of the project or corresponding major component, respectively.
#
# \note The BASIS Template must follow this directory structure.
#       Ideally, when changing the name of one of these directories,
#       only the directory structure of the tempate needs to be updated.
#       The BASIS CMake functions should not be required to change as they
#       are supposed to use these variables instead of the actual names.
