INTRODUCTION
============

  This guide defines the process of creating a new, temporary development branch
  and of creating a release version of a software project.

SOFTWARE RELEASE
================

  Whenever the software of a project is to be used by another project or user,
  the following steps have to be performed in order to create a new release
  version of the software.

  1. If the development of was carried out in a branch other than the trunk,
     the changes which shall be part of the release version have to be merged
     back to the trunk.

     Therefore, use the svn merge command.

     http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html

  2. The trunk is copied to branches/release/. This branch is referred to as
     release candidate.

     This is done using the svn copy command.

  3. Next the version information of the release candidate is updated such that
     it is assigned a unique version number.

     Note: The trunk and any other development branch is not associated with a
           version other than the revision number as these branches are always
           considered to be in development.

  4. Then the testers are selected and informed to retrieve a copy of release
     candidate, i.e., the branch branches/release/. According to the testers
     feedback, the release candidate is bug fixed until all tests are passed.

  5. Once the release candidate is stable, i.e., passes all tests, a tag of the
     release candidate is made by copying it to tags/<project>-<version>.

  6. Finally, the bug fixes applied to the release candidate are merged back
     to the trunk and the release candidate is deleted.

  7. Optionally, binary and source distribution packages are generated from the
     tagged release branch.

  8. The users are informed that a new release is available and the SBIA Wiki
     page "Software Projects" is updated.
