# \file  FindBASIS.cmake
# \brief Find BASIS package or specific components only.
#
# Input variables:
#
#   BASIS_DIR          The BASIS package files are searched under the
#                      specified root directory. If they are not found
#                      there, the default search paths are considered.
#                      This variable can also be set as environment variable.
#
# Sets the following CMake variables:
#
#   BASIS_FOUND        Whether the BASIS package was found and the
#                      following CMake variables are valid.
#   BASIS_INCLUDE_DIR  Cached include directory/ies.
#   BASIS_INCLUDE_DIRS Alias for BASIS_INCLUDE_DIR (not cached).
#   BASIS_INCLUDES     Alias for BASIS_INCLUDE_DIR (not cached).
#   BASIS_LIB          Path of BASIS libraries.
#   BASIS_LIBRARY      Alias for BASIS_LIB (not cached).
#   BASIS_LIBRARIES    Path of BASIS libraries and prerequisite libraries.
#
# Moreover, if BASIS_FIND_COMPONENTS was specified, it sets the above
# variables separately for each component listed, where the component
# name is given in BASIS_FIND_COMPONENTS is used as infix after BASIS_.
# For example, the variable BASIS_Core_FOUND determines whether the
# BASIS Core was found or not.
