# @file  ScriptConfig.cmake
# @brief Default script configuration.
#
# @note The file ScriptConfig.cmake.in is configured and used by BASIS to
#       generate CMake build scripts used to "build" script files.
#
# This CMake file defines CMake variables which can be used within scripts.
# If the project structure differs for the build tree and the install tree,
# the CMake variables used within the script can be set depending on the
# value of the variable @c BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT. This variable evaluates to
# true, when the script is build, i.e., configured, for the installation tree
# and to false, otherwise.
#
# Example:
# @code
# if (BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT)
#   set (BIN_DIR "@INSTALL_BIN_DIR@")
# else ()
#   set (BIN_DIR "@CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY@")
# endif ()
# @endcode
#
# Avoid the use of absolute paths, however! Instead, use the variable
# SCRIPT_DIR which is set to the directory of the script file to make these
# paths relative to the directory of the script file. The relative paths
# determined by the script configuration script shall be used in the script.
# Therefore, the script has to determine its directory at runtime. This can
# usually easily be done by extracting the path component from the first argument.
# To ease this task, BASIS provides utility functions for each supported
# scripting language which can be used for that.
#
# Example for BASH:
# @code
# # /usr/bin/env bash
# @BASIS_BASH_UTILITIES@
# get_executable_directory exec_dir
# [ $? -eq 0 ] || { echo 'Failed to get directory of this executable'; exit 1; }
# data_dir="${exec_dir}/@DATA_DIR@"
# @endcode
#
# where @c DATA_DIR is the relative path determined during the script
# configuration. See documentation of basis_set_script_path_definition()
# for a convenience function which can be used just for that. This function
# generates the definition of a function which is prepended to this script
# configuration. Use this function as follows in the script configuration file.
#
# Example:
# @code
# basis_set_script_path (DATA_DIR "@PROJECT_DATA_DIR@" "@INSTALL_DATA_DIR@")
# @endcode
