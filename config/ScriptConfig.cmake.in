# \file  ScriptConfig.cmake.in
# \brief Default script configuration template.
#
# This CMake file defines CMake variables which can be used within scripts.
# If the project structure differs for the build tree and the install tree,
# the CMake variables used within the script can be set depending on the
# value of the variable BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT. This variable evaluates to true,
# when the script is build, i.e., configured, for the installation tree and
# to false, otherwise.
#
# Example:
# \code
# if (BUILD_INSTALL_SCRIPT)
#   set (BIN_DIR "@INSTALL_PREFIX@/bin")
# else ()
#   set (BIN_DIR "@RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY@")
# endif ()
# \endcode
#
# Avoid the use of absolute paths, however! Instead, use the variable
# @SCRIPT_DIR@ which is set to the directory of the script file to make these
# paths relative to the directory of the script file. The relative paths
# determined by the script configuration script shall be used in the script.
# Therefore, the script has to determine its directory at runtime. This can
# usually easily be done by extracting the path component from the first argument.
#
# Example:
# \code
# #! /usr/bin/env bash
# progDir=`dirname $0`
# dataDir=$progDir/@DATA_DIR@
# \endcode
#
# where DATA_DIR is the relative path determined during the script configuration.
# See documentation of basis_set_script_path_definition () for a convenience
# function which can be used just for that. This function generates the
# definition of a function which is prepended to this script configuration.
# Use this function as follows within this file.
#
# Example:
# \code
# basis_set_script_path (DATA_DIR "@PROJECT_DATA_DIR@" "@INSTALL_DATA_DIR@")
# \endcode
