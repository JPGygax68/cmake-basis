# @note The @USE_FILE@ file is automatically generated
#       by BASIS from the template file ConfigUse.cmake.in which is part of
#       this package.
#
# In the default package use file of BASIS, which can be included here using
# the \@BASIS_USE\@ variable, the prefix used by the package configuration
# file is defined as @c NS variable. Thus, to use any variable set by the
# corresponding package configuration file, use code similar to:
#
# @code
# include_directories (${${NS}INCLUDE_DIRS})
# @endcode
#
# See the ConfigUse.cmake.in file of BASIS for details.
#
# @note The CMake code which is substituted for the \@BASIS_USE\@ variable
#       contains an include guard.

#       have to be cached such that the FindPythonInterpr.cmake, FindPerl.cmake,
#       and FindBASH.cmake modules find the respective executable.
