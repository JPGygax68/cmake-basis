INTRODUCTION
============

  The BASIS example component demonstrates the use of the BASIS package.
  Each of the examples is a separate project which follows BASIS and therefore
  is derived from the BASIS template.



PACKAGE OVERVIEW
================

  HelloWorld
  ----------

  This is the typical Hello World example. This project only consists of one
  single command-line program, which prints this famous greeting and exits.


  MatlabProgram
  -------------

  The command-line program of this example project is implemented in MATLAB.
  It demonstrates the use of the MATLAB Compiler to build the binary executable.
  Using the MATLAB Compiler instead of native C/C++ compilers such as the ones
  of the GNU Compiler Collection is as ease as in case of the latter thanks to
  the CMake functions provided by BASIS.


  MEXFunction
  -----------

  This example project demonstrates the use of MATLAB's MEX-file generation
  script mex. The generated MEX file is a shared library with an entry point
  for MATLAB to call the contained MEX function that is implemented in C.


  MatlabITK
  ---------

  An advanced use of the BASIS CMake-based MATLAB support is given in this
  example project. A MEX-file and a MATLAB Compiler generated command-line
  program are implemented. The MEX-file is implemented in C++ and makes use
  of the ITK ImageReader and ImageWriter classes.
