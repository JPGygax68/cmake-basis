<h1>Project Template<a class="headerlink" href="#project-template" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The BASIS Project Template defines a standardized project directory
and file structure for consistency and interoperability that is required
to follow the BASIS standard. The idea is to make projects easier for
developers to create, share, and use. It provides template files for the
configuration of the build, testing, installation, and packaging, as well
as a common directory structure which can be found at <a class="reference internal" href="fhs.html"><em>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</em></a>.
The Software Project Template also defines how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CMakeLists.txt</span></tt>
files are set up and the basic build flags that are required.
The easiest way to get started is by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">basisproject</span></tt> utility
to generate a completed template for your project that follows this standard,
see the <a class="reference internal" href="../../quickstart.html"><em>Quick Start</em></a> section for more details on getting started.</p>
<div class="section" id="required-project-files">
<h2>Required Project Files<a class="headerlink" href="#required-project-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following files have to be part of any project which follows the <a class="reference internal" href="fhs.html"><em>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</em></a>.
These are thus the minimal set of project files which need to be selected
when instantiating a new software project. Besides these files, a project
will have either a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt> directory or a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">modules/</span></tt> directory,
or even both of them. See below for a description of these directories.</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="readme">
<dt>README.txt</dt>
<dd>This is the main (root) documentation file. Every user is
assumed to first read this file, which in turn will refer
them to the more extensive documentation. This file in
particular introduces the software package shortly, including a
summary of the package files. Moreover, it refers to the
<a class="reference internal" href="#install"><em>INSTALL.txt</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#copying"><em>COPYING.txt</em></a>
files for details on the build and installation and software license,
respectively. Furthermore, references to scientific articles related
to the software package shall be included in this file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>AUTHORS.txt</dt>
<dd>Names the authors of the software package. People who
notably contributed to the software directly should also be named
here as well, even if they did not actually edit any project
file. Others, who mostly contributed indirectly should be
named in the <a class="reference internal" href="#readme"><em>README.txt</em></a> file instead. No author names shall
be given in any particular source code file, as these are generally
edited by multiple persons and updating the authors information
within each source file is tedious.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="copying">
<dt>COPYING.txt</dt>
<dd>Contains copyright and license information. If some files
of the project were copied from other sources, the copyright
and license information of these files shall be stated here
as well. It is important to clearly state which copyright
and license text corresponds to which project files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="install">
<dt>INSTALL.txt</dt>
<dd>Contains build and installation instructions. As the build
of all projects which follow BASIS is very similar, this
file shall only describe additional steps/CMake variables
which are not described in the <a class="reference internal" href="../../howto/install.html"><em>Install any Software</em></a> guide.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="basisproject">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.andreasschuh.com/cmake-basis/apidoc/latest/BasisProject_8cmake.html">BasisProject.cmake</a></dt>
<dd>This file contains the meta-data of the project such as
the project name and release version, its brief description which
is used for the packaging, and the dependencies. Note that additional
dependencies may be given by the CMake code in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#depends"><em>config/Depends.cmake</em></a> file, if such file is present.
This file mainly consists of a call to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.andreasschuh.com/cmake-basis/apidoc/latest/group__CMakeAPI.html#gad82d479d14499d09c5aeda3af646b9f6">basis_project()</a> command. If the project is a module
of another project, this file is read by the top-level project
to be able to identify its modules and the dependencies among them.</dd>
<dt>CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>The root CMake configuration file. <strong>Do not edit this file.</strong></dd>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>build/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>CMake configuration file for bundle build (also referred to as super-build)
of the project and all or some of its prerequisites. The source packages
of the prerequisites are either downloaded during the bundle build or
may be included with the distribution package. In the latter case, these
source packages shall be placed in the build/ directory next to this
CMake configuration file.</dd>
<dt>CTestConfig.cmake</dt>
<dd>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/ctest.html">CTest</a> configuration file. This file in particular
specifies the URL of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cdash.org/">CDash</a> dashboard of the project
where test results should be submitted to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="settings">
<dt>config/Settings.cmake</dt>
<dd>This is the main CMake script file used to configure the build
system, and BASIS in particular. Any CMake code required to configure
the build system, such as adding common compiler flags, or adding
common definitions which have not yet been added by the generic code
used by BASIS to utilize a found dependency should go into this file.</dd>
<dt>config/ScriptConfig.cmake.in</dt>
<dd>See the documentation on the <a class="reference internal" href="scripttargets.html"><em>build of script targets</em></a>
for details on how this <a class="reference internal" href="scripttargets.html#scriptconfig"><em>script configuration</em></a> is used.</dd>
<dt>data/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>This CMake configuration file contains code to simply install every file
and directory from the source tree into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">INSTALL_DATA_DIR</span></tt> directory
of the installation tree.</dd>
<dt>doc/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>This CMake configuration file adds rules to build the documentation
from, for example, the in-source comments using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>
sources using <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>. Moreover, for every documentation file, such as the
software manual, the <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.andreasschuh.com/cmake-basis/apidoc/latest/group__CMakeAPI.html#ga06f94c5d122393ad4e371f73a0803cfa">basis_add_doc()</a> command has to be added to
this file.</dd>
<dt>doc/index.rst</dt>
<dd>The main page of the <cite>comprehensive</cite> software manual which may also serve as
project web site at the same time.</dd>
<dt>doc/manual/index.rst</dt>

development or maintenance of the software.</dd>
<dt>doc/site/indes.rst</dt>
<dd>The main page of the project web site.</dd>
<dt>example/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>This CMake configuration file contains by default code to install every
file and directory from the source tree into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">INSTALL_EXAMPLE_DIR</span></tt>
directory of the installation tree. It may be modified to configure
and/or build certain files of the example if applicable or required.</dd>
<dt>src/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>The definition of all software build targets shall be added to this
file, using the commands <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.andreasschuh.com/cmake-basis/apidoc/latest/group__CMakeAPI.html#ga3a56e2ed99608316be7309fcc090cc66">basis_add_library()</a> to add a shared,
static, or module library, which can also be a module written in a scripting
language, and <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.andreasschuh.com/cmake-basis/apidoc/latest/group__CMakeAPI.html#gab7b7600c0ab4197db811f810a04670be">basis_add_executable()</a> to add an executable target,
which can be either a binary or a script file. If appropriate,
the source code files may be further organized in subdirectories
of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt> directory, in which case either separate
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CMakeLists.txt</span></tt> files can be used for each subdirectory,
or yet all targets are added to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/CMakeLists.txt</span></tt>
file using relative paths which include the subdirectory in which
the source files are found. In general, if the number of source
code files is low, i.e., close to or below 20, no subdirectory
structure is required.</dd>
<dt>test/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>Tests are added to this build configuration file using the
<a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.andreasschuh.com/cmake-basis/apidoc/latest/group__CMakeAPI.html#ga4f8b3637e8577369144ad177d35446f8">basis_add_test()</a> command. The test input files are usually put
in a subdirectory named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/input/</span></tt>, while the baseline
data of the expected test output is stored inside a subdirectory
named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/baseline/</span></tt>. Generally, however, the <a class="reference internal" href="fhs.html"><em>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</em></a> of
BASIS does not dictate how the test sources, input, and baseline
data have to be organized inside the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/</span></tt> directory.</dd>
<dt>test/internal/CMakeLists.txt</dt>
<dd>More elaborate and extended tests which are intended for internal use only
and which shall be excluded from the public source distribution package
are configured using this CMake configuration file. Reasons for excluding
tests from a public distribution are that some tests may depend on the
internal software environment to succeed and further the particular
machine architecture. Moreover, the size of the downloadable distribution
packages shall be kept as small as possible and therefore some of the
more specialized tests may be excluded from this distribution.</dd>
<dt>modules/</dt>
<dd>If the project files are organized into conceptual cohesive groups,
similar to the modularization goal of the ITK 4, this directory
contains these conceptual modules of the project. The files of each
module reside in a subdirectory named after the module. Note that each
module itself is a project derived from this project template.</dd>

<div class="section" id="advanced-project-files">
<h2>Advanced Project Files<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-project-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The customization of the following files is usually not required, and hence,
in most cases, most of these files need not to be part of a project.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>config/Components.cmake</dt>
<dd>Contains CMake code to configure the components used by
component-based installers. Currently, component-based installers
are not very well supported by BASIS, and hence this file
is mostly unused and is yet subject to change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="config-in">
<dt>config/Config.cmake.in</dt>
<dd>This is the template of the package configuration file.
When the project is configured/installed using CMake,
a configured version of this file is copied to the build
or installation tree, respectively, where the information
about the package configuration is substituted as appropriate
for the actual build/installation of the package. For example,
the configured file contains the absolute path to the
installed public header files such that other packages can
easily add this path to their include search path.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:find_package">find_package()</a> command of CMake, in particular, will look
for this file and automatically import the CMake settings when
this software package was found. For many projects, the default
package configuration file of BASIS which is used if this file
is missing in the project&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/</span></tt> directory,
is sufficient and thus this file is often not required.</dd>
<dt>config/ConfigSettings.cmake</dt>
<dd>This file sets CMake variables for use in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#config-in"><em>config/Config.cmake.in</em></a> file. As the package configuration
for the final installation differs from the one of the build tree,
this file has to contain CMake code to set the variables used in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#config-in"><em>config/Config.cmake.in</em></a> file differently depending on whether
the variables are being set for use within the build tree or the
installation tree. This file only needs to be present if the project
uses a custom <a class="reference internal" href="#config-in"><em>config/Config.cmake.in</em></a> file, which in turn
contains CMake variables whose value differs between build tree and
installation.</dd>
<dt>config/ConfigUse.cmake.in</dt>
<dd>This file is provided for convenience of the user of the
software package. It contains CMake code which uses the
variables set by the package configuration file (i.e.,
the file generated from the file <a class="reference internal" href="#config-in"><em>config/Config.cmake.in</em></a>)
in order to configure the build system of packages which
use this software packages properly such that they can
make use of this software. For example, the package
configuration sets a variable to a list of include directories
have to be added to the include search path. This file would then contain
CMake instructions to actually add these directories to the path.</dd>
<dt>config/ConfigVersion.cmake.in</dt>
<dd>This file accompanies the package configuration file
generated from the <a class="reference internal" href="#config-in"><em>config/Config.cmake.in</em></a> file. It is used
by CMake&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#command:find_package">find_package()</a> command to identify versions of this software
package which are compatible with the version requested by the dependent
project. This file needs almost never be customized by a project
and thus should generally not be included in a project&#8217;s source tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="depends">
<dt>config/Depends.cmake</dt>
<dd>If the generic code used by BASIS to resolve the dependencies on external
packages is not sufficient, add this file to your project. CMake code required
to find and make use of external software packages properly shall be added
to this file. In order to only make use of the variables set by the package
configuration of the found dependency, consider to add a dependency entry
to the <a class="reference internal" href="#basisproject"><em>BasisProject.cmake</em></a> file instead and code to use
these variables to <a class="reference internal" href="#settings"><em>config/Settings.cmake</em></a>.</dd>
<dt>config/Package.cmake</dt>
<dd>Configures <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cpack.html">CPack</a>, the package generator of CMake.
The packaging of software using CPack is currently not completely
supported by BASIS. This template file is yet subject to change.</dd>
