{"name":"BASIS","tagline":"CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard","body":"The **CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard** documents and implements a standard for project organization, software build using CMake, and software implementation and documentation. The BASIS project was started in February 2011 at the [Section of Biomedical Image Analysis (SBIA)][1], Department of Radiology, University of Pennslyvania. The initial idea was only to provide a\r\nproject template based on CMake which would standardize the project directory\r\nstructure as well as the software build. Besides, this project template\r\nwould allow the developers to concentrate on the actual software rather than\r\non deciding upon the directory structure, the directory names, and the basic\r\nCMake configuration. To provide an even more comprehensive basis for the\r\nsoftware development at SBIA, the BASIS project goes, however, two steps\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nIn first place, BASIS has to be considered a standard regarding the software\r\ndevelopment which is documented as part of the [Software Manual][3].\r\nBased on this standard, a [project template][4] is provided which implements\r\nthe [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][5]. This template is further accompanied by\r\n[CMake modules][6] which not only follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard,\r\nbut also implement the build system standard as well as the standard on testing\r\nand packaging software.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]:  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/\r\n[2]:  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/license.html\r\n[3]:  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/help.html\r\n[4]:  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/standard/template.html\r\n[5]:  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/standard/fhs.html\r\n[6]:  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/apidoc/latest/group__BasisModules.html","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
