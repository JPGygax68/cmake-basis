CMake BASIS
===========

The (CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS))[http://schuhschuh.github.io/cmake-basis] makes it
easy to create sharable software and libraries that work together. This is accomplished
by combining and documenting some of the best practices and utilities available.
More importantly, BASIS supplies a fully integrated suite of functionality to make
the whole process seamless!
