        <p>The <strong>CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard</strong> documents and implements a standard for project organization, software build using CMake, and software implementation and documentation. The BASIS project was started in February 2011 at the <a href="http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/">Section of Biomedical Image Analysis (SBIA)</a>, Department of Radiology, University of Pennslyvania. The initial idea was only to provide a
project template based on CMake which would standardize the project directory
structure as well as the software build. Besides, this project template
would allow the developers to concentrate on the actual software rather than
on deciding upon the directory structure, the directory names, and the basic
CMake configuration. To provide an even more comprehensive basis for the
software development at SBIA, the BASIS project goes, however, two steps
further.</p>

<p>In first place, BASIS has to be considered a standard regarding the software
development which is documented as part of the <a href="http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/help.html">Software Manual</a>.
Based on this standard, a <a href="http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/standard/template.html">project template</a> is provided which implements
the <a href="http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/standard/fhs.html">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>. This template is further accompanied by
<a href="http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/apidoc/latest/group__BasisModules.html">CMake modules</a> which not only follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard,
but also implement the build system standard as well as the standard on testing
and packaging software.</p>
