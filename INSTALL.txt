INTRODUCTION
============

  This document contains the build and installation instructions.

  For general build and installation instructions which apply to any software
  developed on top of the SBIA Build system And Software Implementation Standard
  (BASIS), please refer to the INSTALL-basis document which can be either found
  in the doc/ directory of your BASIS installation or online at [1].



OBTAINING A COPY OF THE SOFTWARE
================================

  Please see corresponding section in the INSTALL-basis document [1].



INSTALLING A BINARY DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
========================================

  Please see corresponding section in the INSTALL-basis document [1].



RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS
====================

  This software has no runtime dependencies.



BUILDING THE SOFTWARE FROM SOURCES
==================================

  In the following, only the additional build dependencies and CMake settings
  available to configure this software package are summarized. For a list of
  general build dependencies and step-by-step instructions on how to use CMake
  and GNU Make to build and install the software, please refer to the
  corresponding section in the INSTALL-basis document [1].


  Build Dependencies
  ------------------

  - ITK 3.14 or greater (optional)

    Web:      http://www.itk.org
    Download: http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html
    Ubuntu:   libinsighttoolkit3.18 (maverick)

    The standalone basistest-driver executable currently makes use of the ITK,
    either version 3 or 4 and above, for the comparison of a test image to one
    or more baseline images. If no installation of this library is found, this
    executable is excluded from the build and installation. Note that many
    packages developed at SBIA make use of this executable in their tests.
    If BASIS has been built without the basistest-driver, these packages have
    to be built with BUILD_TESTING option set to OFF.

    If you install BASIS for use with different projects which depend on it
    and if you want to be flexible regarding the ITK version used by each of
    these projects, it is required to link BASIS to a static build of the ITK,
    i.e., a build where BUILD_SHARE_LIBRARIES was set to OFF during the
    configuration of the ITK build tree. Otherwise, all projects which make use
    of BASIS have to link against the same version of ITK, which is no problem
    for systems with only one version of ITK installed, however.



  CMake Options
  -------------

  Depending on which language interpreters are installed on your system,
  the following CMake options are available:

  USE_CXX            Whether to build/enable the C++ utilities.
  USE_PythonInterp   Whether to build/enable the Python utilities.
  USE_Perl           Whether to build/enable the Perl utilities.
  USE_BASH           Whether to build/enable the BASH utilities.


  Advanced CMake Options
  ----------------------

  (no additional advanced CMake options considered by this package)
