INTRODUCTION
============

  This design document details the design and implementation of the
  superproject/subproject concept and corresponding project organization.
  A superproject can also be viewed as the actual modularized project, where
  each subproject is one module of this superproject which may depend on other
  modules of the same superproject or external projects (also referred to as
  packages). Note that an external project in this context can be another
  super- or subproject implementing the same superproject/subproject concept
  as discussed herein, i.e., software developed at SBIA based on BASIS.
  To some extent, this concept of modularization was similarly implemented by
  the developers of the ITK 4 [1]. In fact, the ITK 4 project was a great
  ressource on several aspects which were implemented as part of BASIS.
