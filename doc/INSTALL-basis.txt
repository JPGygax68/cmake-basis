INTRODUCTION
============

  This document describes the common procedure to build and install any
  software developed at and distributed by SBIA. In particular, software built
  on top of BASIS, a meta-project which defines the Build system And Software
  Implementation Standard established in the fall of 2011.
  Please refer to the documentation of BASIS for details on this standard.

  If you obtained a binary distribution package for a supported platform,
  please follow the installation instructions corresponding to your operating
  system. The build step can be omitted in this case.

  In case of problems to build, install, or use the software, please contact
  the SBIA Group at the University of Pennsylvania, PA.

  In the following, $ at the beginning of a line indicates the command prompt of
  the used shell. Hence, the command followed after the $ has to be entered in a
  terminal. The instructions given in this guide are based on BASH, in particular.


  Attention: When this document has been modified, the corresponding publicly
             available web page has to be modified accordingly! This web page
             is referenced by each project and can be found at [1].



OBTAINING A COPY OF THE SOFTWARE
================================

  Visit https://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/index.html for an overview of
  publicly available software distribution packages.

  A download link for a specific software package can be requested at:

    https://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/request.php

  The file names of the distribution packages follow the convention
  "<package>-<version>-<arch>.<ext>", where <package> is the name of the
  package in lowercase letters, and <version> is the package version in the
  format "<major>.<minor>.<patch>". The <arch> file name part specifies the
  operating system and hardware architecture, i.e.,

    linux-x86     ->  Linux, 32-bit
    linux-x86_64  ->  Linux, 64-bit
    darwin-i386   ->  Darwin x86 Intel
    darwin-ppc    ->  Darwin Power PC
    win32         ->  Windows, 32-bit
    win64         ->  Windows, 64-bit

  In case of a source distribution package the value of <arch> is "source".
  The file name extension <ext> is "tar.gz" for a compressed tarball,
  "deb" for a Debian package, and "rpm" for a RPM package.



INSTALLING A BINARY DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
========================================

  Debian Package
  --------------

    This package can be installed on Debian Linux and its derivatives such as
    Ubuntu Linux using, for example, the Advanced Package Tool (APT).

    To install the software package, run

      $ sudo apt-get install <package>-<version>-<arch>.deb

    in a terminal or use the package manager of your choice.


  RPM Package
  -----------

    This package can be installed on Red Hat Linux and its derivatives such as
    CentOS Linux and openSUSE Linux using, for example, the Yellowdog Updater,
    Modified (YUM).

    To install the software package, run

      $ sudo yum install <package>-<version>-<arch>.deb

    in a terminal or use the RPM package manager of your choice.


  Mac OS
  ------

    Bundles for Mac OS might be available for some software packages,
    but this is not supported by default. Please refer to the INSTALL file which
    is located in the root directory of the respective software package.


  Windows
  -------

    Currently, Microsoft Windows is not supported as operating system.
    The software development at SBIA is based on Linux, in particular
    CentOS, and most software packages are therefore dependent on a
    UNIX-based operating system. Thus, building and executing SBIA software
    under Windows will most likely require an installation of Cygwin
    (http://www.cygwin.com/) and the build of the software from sources
    as described below.

    As an alternative, consider the use of a Live Linux Distribution,
    a dual boot installation of Linux or an installation of a Linux operating
    system in a virtual machine using virtualization tools such as VirtualBox
    (http://www.virtualbox.org/) or proprietary virtualization solutions
    available for your host operating system.



BUILDING THE SOFWARE FROM SOURCES
=================================

  Build Dependencies
  ------------------

  The build of the software packages developed at SBIA is based on CMake,
  a cross-platform, open-source build tool. This tool can be used to configure
  the build system for various build tools which perform the actual build.
  Because of the focus on Linux-based development at SBIA, build instructions
  are based on GNU Make and the GNU Compiler Collection.

  - GNU Compiler Collection

    Web Site: http://gcc.gnu.org/
    Download: http://gcc.gnu.org/install/
    Ubuntu:   g++

  - GNU Make

    Web Site: http://www.gnu.org/
    Download: http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html
    Ubuntu:   (pre-installed)

  - CMake 2.8.4 or greater

    Web Site: http://www.cmake.org/
    Download: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
    Ubuntu:   cmake, cmake-curses-gui

    If your operating system such as certain Linux distributions do not
    support CMake 2.8.4 or greater yet, you need to download a more recent
    CMake version from the download page noted above and install it manually.
    Often this is easiest accomplished by using the CMake version supported
    by your platform itself to configure the build system for the more
    recent CMake version. In order to not conflict with the CMake installation
    of your particular Linux distribution, it is recommended to install your
    own build of CMake in a different directory or to at least remove the
    pre-installed CMake installation prior to installing the new version.

  - BASIS

    Web Site: http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/doxygen/basis/trunk/html/
    Download: http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/distributions/basis-current-source.tar.gz

    The Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS) among other
    features defines the project directory structure and provides CMake
    implementations to ease and standardize the build and installation.
    Refer to the INSTALL document of the software package you want to build
    and install for information on which particular BASIS version is required
    by this package.


  Build and Installation Instructions
  -----------------------------------

  In the following, we assume you obtained a copy of the source package as
  compressed tarball (*.tar.gz). The name and version part of the package file
  is referred to as BASH variable

    $ pkg=<package>-<version>

  1. Extract the source tree

     At first, extract the downloaded source package, e.g.,

       $ tar xzf $pkg-source.tar.gz ~

     This will extract the sources to a new diretory in your home directory
     named "<package>-<version>-source".

  2. Configure the build tree

     Create a directory for the build tree of the package and change to it, e.g.,

       $ mkdir ~/$pkg-build
       $ cd ~/$pkg-build

     Note that an in-source build, i.e., building the software within the
     source tree is not supported to force a clear separation of source and
     build tree.

     To configure the build tree, run CMake's graphical tool ccmake

       $ ccmake ~/$pkg-source

     Put "c" to trigger the configuration step of CMake. Warnings can be
     ignored by pressing "e". Once all CMake variables are configured
     properly, which might require the repeated execution of CMake's configure
     step, press "g". This will generate the configuration files for the
     selected build tool (i.e., GNU Make Makefiles in our case) and exit CMake.

     The common CMake variables which configure the build and installation are:

     - BUILD_CHANGELOG       Request build of ChangeLog as part of the ALL target.
                             Note that the ChangeLog is generated either from the
                             Subversion history if the source tree is a SVN
                             working copy, or from the Git history if it is a
                             Git repository. Otherwise, the ChangeLog cannot be
                             generated and this option is disabled again by BASIS.
                             In case of Subversion, be aware that the generation
                             of the ChangeLog takes several minutes and may require
                             the input of user credentials for access to the
                             Subversion repository. It is recommended to leave
                             this option disabled and to build the "changelog" target
                             separate from the rest of the software package instead
                             (see step 4 below).
     - BUILD_DOCUMENTATION   Whether build and installation instructions for the
                             documentation should be added. If OFF, the
                             build configuration of the doc/ directory is skipped.
                             Otherwise, the "doc" target is added which is used
                             to build the documentation.
     - BUILD_EXAMPLE         Whether the examples should be built (if required)
                             and/or installed.
     - BUILD_TESTING         Whether the testing tree should be built and system
                             tests, i.e., tests that execute the installed programs
                             and compare the outputs to the expected results should
                             be installed (if done so by the software package).
     - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE      Specify the build configuration to build. If not
                             set, the "Release" configuration will be build.
                             Valid values are "Release", "Debug", and "Coverage".
     - INSTALL_LINKS         Whether (symbolic) links should be created (see Step 5).
     - INSTALL_PREFIX        Prefix used for package installation (see Step 5).
     - INSTALL_SINFIX        Whether to use suffix/infix for installation (see Step 5).
     - USE_<Pkg>             If the software you are building has declared
                             optional dependencies, i.e., software packages which
                             it makes use of if available, for each such optional
                             package a USE_<Pkg> option is added by BASIS if this
                             package was found on your system. It can be set to
                             OFF in order to disable the use of this optional
                             dependency by this software.

     Note that INSTALL_PREFIX is initialized by the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX,
     the default used by CMake to specify the installation prefix. Then, the
     value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is forced to be identical to INSTALL_PREFIX,
     effectively renaming CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to INSTALL_PREFIX.

     The advanced CMake settings are:

     - BASIS_COMPILE_SCRIPTS      Enable compilation of Python modules. If this option
                                  is enabled, only the compiled .pyc files are installed.
     - BASIS_DEBUG                Enable debugging messages during build configuration.
     - BASIS_INSTALL_SINFIX       The sinfix to use for the installation if INSTALL_SINFIX
                                  is set to ON. Otherwise, this values is ignored.
     - BASIS_MCC_FLAGS            Additional flags for MATLAB Compiler.
     - BASIS_MCC_MATLAB_MODE      Whether to call the MATLAB Compiler in MATLAB mode.
                                  If ON, the MATLAB Compiler is called from within a
                                  MATLAB interpreter session, which results in the
                                  immediate release of the MATLAB Compiler license
                                  once the compilation is done. Otherwise, the license
                                  is reserved for a fixed amount of time (e.g. 30 min).
     - BASIS_MCC_RETRY_ATTEMPTS   Number of times the compilation of MATLAB Compiler
                                  target is repeated in case of a license checkout
                                  error.
     - BASIS_MCC_RETRY_DELAY      Delay in seconds between retries to build MATLAB
                                  Compiler targets after a license checkout error
                                  has occurred.
     - BASIS_MCC_TIMEOUT          Timeout in seconds for the build of a MATLAB Compiler
                                  target. If the build of the target could not be
                                  finished within the specified time, the build is
                                  interrupted.
     - BASIS_MEX_FLAGS            Additional flags for the MEX script.
     - BASIS_MEX_TIMEOUT          Timeout in seconds for the build of MEX-files.
     - BASIS_VERBOSE              Enable verbose messages during build configuration.
     - INSTALL_APIDOC_DIR         Installation directory of the API documentation
                                  relative to the INSTALL_PREFIX.

     Please refer also to the package specific build instructions given in the
     INSTALL file of the corresponding package which is located in the root directory
     of the source tree or the 'doc' directory of the installation. In this document,
     additional project specific CMake variables and options may be listed.

     Hint: The ccmake tool also provides a brief description to each variable
           in the status bar.

  3. Build the software

     To build the package executables and libraries, run GNU Make in the root
     directory of the configured build tree, i.e.,

       $ make

  4. Build the documentation (optional)

     In order to build the documentation, the BUILD_DOCUMENTATION variable
     has to be set to ON. If not done before, this option can be enabled by
     using the command:

       $ cmake -D BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON ~/$pkg-build

     The documentation is build by building the "doc" target, i.e.,

       $ make doc

     If the BUILD_DOCUMENTATION option has been set to ON before, the doc target
     has already been build as part of the software build itself, i.e., when
     running make as in step 3.

     The advanced INSTALL_APIDOC_DIR CMake variable can be set to an absolute
     path or a path relative to the INSTALL_PREFIX directory in order to modify
     the installation directory for the API documentation which is generated
     from the in-source comments. This can be useful, for example, to install
     the documentation in the document directory of a web server.

     If the source tree is a Subversion working copy and you have access to the
     Subversion repository of the project or if the project source tree is a Git
     repository, a ChangeLog file can be generated from the commit history by
     building the "changelog" target, i.e.,

       $ make changelog

     In case of Subversion, be aware that the generation of the ChangeLog takes
     several minutes and may require the input of your user credentials for access
     to the Subversion repository. Moreover, if the command svn2cl [2] is installed
     on your system, it will be used to format the ChangeLog. Otherwise, the plain
     output of the "svn log" command is used.

  5. Install the package (optional)

     First, make sure that the CMake variables INSTALL_PREFIX and
     INSTALL_SINFIX are set properly by running CMake as follows:

       $ cmake -D "INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>" -D "INSTALL_SINFIX=ON|OFF" ~/$pkg-build

     This can be omitted if these variables were set already during the
     configuration of the build tree or if the default values should be used.
     On Linux, INSTALL_PREFIX is by default set to "/usr/local". Note that the
     following strings can be used in the specification of this variable which
     will be substituted by the corresponding package specific values.

     - @PROJECT_NAME@            The case-sensitive name of the software package.
     - @PROJECT_NAME_UPPER@      The name of the package in uppercase only.
     - @PROJECT_NAME_LOWER@      The name of the package in lowercase only.
     - @PROJECT_VERSION@         The package version.
     - @PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR@   The major number of the package version.
     - @PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR@   The minor number of the package version.
     - @PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH@   The patch number of the package version.

     After the package was configured successfully, the executables and
     auxiliary files can be installed using the command

       $ make install

     in the root directory of the build tree. This will copy the installation
     files into the directories specified during the configuration step.
 
     The package files are installed in the following locations:

     - <prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/               Main executable files.
     - <prefix>/etc/<sinfix>/               Package configuration files.
     - <prefix>/include/sbia/<package>/     Include files, where <prefix>/include/
                                            is the directory that needs to be
                                            in the search path for include files.
     - <prefix>/lib/<sinfix>/               Libraries and auxiliary executables.
     - <prefix>/lib/python/sbia/<package>   Python modules.
     - <prefix>/lib/perl5/SBIA/<Package>    Perl modules.
     - <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/doc/         Package documentation files.
     - <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/example/     Files required to run example as
                                            described in the User Manual.
     - <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.1    Man pages of main executables.
     - <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.3    Man pages of library functions.

     where <prefix> is the value of INSTALL_PREFIX and <sinfix> is an empty
     string if INSTALL_SINFIX is OFF and the package name in lowercase
     otherwise preceded by the common infix "sbia/" (the default).
     
     If more than one version of a software package shall be installed,
     include the package version in the <prefix> by setting INSTALL_PREFIX
     to "/usr/local/@PROJECT_NAME_LOWER@-@PROJECT_VERSION@", for example,
     and disable the use of the <sinfix> by setting INSTALL_SINFIX to OFF.

     Additionally, if both INSTALL_SINFIX and INSTALL_LINKS are ON (the default),
     the following (symbolic) links are created on UNIX-based systems:

     - <prefix>/bin/<exec>               -> <prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/<exec>
     - <prefix>/share/man/man.1/<exec>.1 -> <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.1/<exec>.1
     - <prefix>/share/man/man.3/<func>.3 -> <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.3/<func>.3

     After the successful installation, the build tree can be deleted.

  6. Setup your environment (optional)

     In order to ease the execution of the main executable files, we suggest to
     add either the path ~/$pkg-build/bin/ or <prefix>/bin/ to the search path
     for executable files, i.e., the PATH environment variable. This is, however,
     generally no requirement for the correct functioning of the software.

     For example,

     $ export PATH="<prefix>/bin/:<prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/:${PATH}"

     or

     $ setenv PATH "<prefix>/bin/:<prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/:${PATH}"


     To be able to use the Python modules of a SBIA software package in your
     own Python scripts, you need to add the path <prefix>/python/ to the search
     path for Python modules, e.g.,

     $ export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:<prefix>/lib/python/"

     or

     $ setenv PYTHONPATH "${PYTHONPATH}:<prefix>/lib/python/"

     or in your Python script

     #! /usr/bin/env python
     import sys
     sys.path.append('<prefix>/lib/python/')
     from sbia.<package> import <module>


     To be able to use the Perl modules of a SBIA software package in your own
     Perl scripts, you need to add the path <prefix>/perl5/ to the search path
     for Perl modules, e.g.,

     $ export PERL5LIB="${PERL5LIB}:<prefix>/lib/perl5/"

     or

     $ setenv PERL5LIB "${PERL5LIB}:<prefix>/lib/perl5/"

     or in your Perl script

     use lib '<prefix>/lib/perl5';
     use SBIA::<Package>::<Module>;


  Makefile-based Deinstallation
  -----------------------------

  In order to undo the installation of the package files built from the sources,
  run the following command in the root directory of the build tree which was
  used to install the package

    $ cd ~/$pkg-build
    $ make uninstall

  Attention: With the current implementation, this command will simply
             delete all the files which were installed during the *last*
             build of the install target ("make install").


  Deinstallation using the Uninstaller
  ------------------------------------

  During the installation, a manifest of all installed files and a CMake
  script which reads in this list in order to remove these files again
  is generated and installed in <prefix>/lib/cmake/<package>/.

  If INSTALL_SINFIX was set to ON during the installation, a shell script
  named "uninstall" was written to the <prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/ directory
  on Unix and a corresponding Batch file on Windows. Additionally, if
  INSTALL_LINKS was set to ON, a symbolic link named "uninstall_<package>"
  was created in <prefix>/bin/. Otherwise, if INSTALL_SINFIX was set to OFF,
  the uninstaller is located in <prefix>/bin/ and named "uninstall_<package>".

  Hence, in order to remove all files installed by this package as well
  as the empty directories left behind inside the installation root directory
  given by <prefix>, run the command

  $ uninstall_<package>

  assuming that you added <prefix>/bin/ to your PATH environment variable.

  The advantage of the uninstaller is, that the build tree is no longer
  required in order to uninstall the software package. Thus, you do not
  need to keep a copy of the build tree once you installed the software
  only to be able to uninstall the package again.
