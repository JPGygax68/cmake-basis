INTRODUCTION
============

  This document describes the common procedure to build and install any
  software developed at and distributed by SBIA. In particular, software built
  on top of BASIS, a meta-project which defines the Build And Software
  Implementation Standard which was established in the summer of 2011.
  Please refer to the documentation of BASIS for details on the standard.

  If you obtained a binary distribution package for a supported platform,
  please follow the installation instructions corresponding to your operating
  system. The build step can be omitted in this case.

  In case of problems to build, install, or use the software, please contact
  the SBIA Group at the University of Pennsylvania, PA.

  In the following, $ at the beginning of a line indicates the command prompt of
  the used shell. Hence, the command followed after the $ has to be entered in a
  terminal. The instructions given in this guide are based on bash.



OBTAINING A COPY OF THE SOFTWARE
================================

  Visit https://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/index.html for an overview of
  publicly available software distribution packages.

  A download link for a specific software package can be requested at:

    https://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/request.php

  The file names of the distribution packages follow the convention
  "<package>-<version>-<arch>.<ext>", where <package> is the name of the
  package in lowercase letters, and <version> is the package version in the
  format "<major>.<minor>.<patch>". The <arch> file name part specifies the
  operating system and hardware architecture, i.e.,

    linux-x86     ->  Linux, 32-bit
    linux-x86_64  ->  Linux, 64-bit
    darwin-i386   ->  Darwin x86 Intel
    darwin-ppc    ->  Darwin Power PC
    win32         ->  Windows, 32-bit
    win64         ->  Windows, 64-bit

  In case of a source distribution package the value of <arch> is "source".
  The file name extension <ext> is "tar.gz" for a compressed tarball,
  "deb" for a Debian package, and "rpm" for a RPM package.



INSTALLING A BINARY DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
========================================

  Debian Package
  --------------

    This package can be installed on Debian Linux and its derivatives such as
    Ubuntu Linux using, for example, the Advanced Package Tool (APT).

    To install the software package, run

      $ sudo apt-get install <package>-<version>-<arch>.deb

    in a terminal or use the package manager of your choice.


  RPM Package
  -----------

    This package can be installed on Red Hat Linux and its derivatives such as
    CentOS Linux and openSUSE Linux using, for example, the Yellowdog Updater,
    Modified (YUM).

    To install the software package, run

      $ sudo yum install <package>-<version>-<arch>.deb

    in a terminal or use the RPM package manager of your choice.


  Mac OS
  ------

    Bundles for Mac OS might be available for some software packages,
    but is not supported by default. Please refer to the INSTALL file which
    is located in the root directory of the respective software package.


  Windows
  -------

    Currently, Microsoft Windows is not supported as operating system.
    The software development at SBIA is based on Linux, in particular
    CentOS, and most software packages are therefore dependent on a
    UNIX-based operating system. Thus, building and executing SBIA software
    under Windows will most likely require an installation of Cygwin
    (http://www.cygwin.com/) and the build of the software from sources
    as described below.

    As an alternative, consider the use of a Live Linux Distribution,
    a dual boot installation of Linux or an installation of a Linux operating
    system in a virtual machine using virtualization tools such as VirtualBox
    (http://www.virtualbox.org/).



BUILDING THE SOFWARE FROM SOURCES
=================================

  Build Dependencies
  ------------------

  The build of the software packages developed at SBIA is based on CMake,
  a cross-platform, open-source build tool. This tool can be used to configure
  the build system for various build tools which perform the actual build.
  Because of the focus on Linux-based development at SBIA, build instructions
  are based on GNU Make and the GNU Compiler Collection.

  - GNU Compiler Collection

    Web:      http://gcc.gnu.org/
    Download: http://gcc.gnu.org/install/

    Ubuntu:   g++

  - GNU Make

    Web:      http://www.gnu.org/
    Download: http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html

    Ubuntu:   (pre-installed)

  - CMake 2.8.2 or greater

    Web:      http://www.cmake.org/
    Download: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

    Ubuntu:   cmake, cmake-curses-gui

  - BASIS

    Web:      https://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/
    Download: https://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/

    The Build And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS) defines the project
    directory structure and provides CMake implementations to ease and
    standardize the build and installation.


  Build and Installation Instructions
  -----------------------------------

  In the following, we assume you obtained a copy of the source package as
  compressed tarball (*.tar.gz). The name and version part of the package file
  is referred to as bash variable

    $ pkg=<package>-<version>

  1. Extract the source tree

     At first, extract the downloaded source package, e.g.,

       $ tar xzf $pkg-source.tar.gz ~

     This will extract the sources in a new diretory in your home directory
     named "<package>-<version>-source".

  2. Configure the build tree

     Create a directory for the build tree of the package and change to it, e.g.,

       $ mkdir ~/$pkg-build
       $ cd ~/$pkg-build

     Note that even though an in-source build is supported by most packages, i.e.,
     building the software within the source tree, it is not recommended.
     A CMake warning will be displayed and the in-source build has to be
     explicitly acknowledged before the configuration step is performed.

     To configure the build tree, run CMake's graphical tool ccmake

       $ ccmake ~/$pkg-source

     Put "c" to trigger the configuration step of CMake. Warnings can be
     ignored by pressing "e". Once all CMake variables are configured
     properly, which might require the repeated execution of CMake's configure
     step, press "g". This will generate the configuration files for the
     selected build tool (i.e., GNU Make Makefiles in our case) and exit CMake.

     The common CMake variables which configure the build process are:

       BUILD_DOC        Whether the documentation target should be built by
                        default, too. If FALSE, the documentation, such as
                        in particular the man pages and API documentation,
                        can be built manually by building the "doc" target.
       BUILD_EXAMPLE    Whether the examples should be built (if required)
                        and/or installed.
       BUILD_TESTING    Whether the testing tree should be built and system
                        tests, i.e., tests that execute the installed programs
                        and compare the outputs to the expected results should
                        be installed.
       BUILD_TYPE       Specify the build configuration to build. If not
                        set, the "Release" configuration will be build.
                        Valid values are "Release", "Debug", and "Coverage".
       INSTALL_PREFIX   Prefix used for package installation (see Step 4).
       INSTALL_SINFIX   Suffix/Infix used for package installation (see Step 4).
       INSTALL_LINKS    Whether (symbolic) links should be created (see Step 4).

     Please refer to the package specific build instructions given in the
     INSTALL file which is located in the root directory of the source tree
     for details on the package specific CMake variables.

     Additionally, refer to the documentation of the CMake variables displayed
     in the status bar of ccmake.

  3. Build the software

     To build the package executables, run GNU Make in the root directory
     of the configured build tree, i.e.,

       $ make

  4. Install the package (optional)

     First, make sure that the CMake variables INSTALL_PREFIX and
     INSTALL_SINFIX are set properly by running CMake as follows:

       $ cmake -DINSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> -DINSTALL_SINFIX=<sinfix>

     This can be omitted if these variables were set already during
     the configuration of the build tree or if the default values
     should be used. On Linux, INSTALL_PREFIX is by default set to
     "/usr/local" and INSTALL_SINFIX to "sbia/<package>".

     After the package was configured successfully, the executables and
     auxiliary files can be installed using the command

       $ make install

     in the root directory of the build tree. This will copy the installation
     files into the directories specified during the configuration of the build
     tree (see build step 2).
 
     This will install the package's files into the following locations:

       <prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/              Main executable files.
       <prefix>/lib/<sinfix>/              Libraries and auxiliary executables.
       <prefix>/etc/<sinfix>/              Package configuration files.
       <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/doc/        Package documentation files.
       <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/data/       Auxiliary package data.
       <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/example/    Files required to run example as
                                             described in the User Manual.
       <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.1   Man pages of main executables.
       <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.3   Man pages of library functions.

     where <prefix> is the value of INSTALL_PREFIX and <sinfix> the value
     of INSTALL_SINFIX. Hence, if more than one version of a software package
     shall be installed, include the package version in the <sinfix>, e.g.,
     "sbia/<package>-<version>".

     Additionally, if <sinfix> is not an empty string and INSTALL_LINKS is
     set to TRUE (the default), the following (symbolic) links are created:

       <prefix>/bin/<exec>               -> <prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/<exec>
       <prefix>/doc/<sinfix>             -> <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/doc/
       <prefix>/share/man/man.1/<exec>.1 -> <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.1/<exec>.1
       <prefix>/share/man/man.3/<func>.3 -> <prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/man.3/<func>.3

     Consider also the package specific installation instructions given in
     the INSTALL file of the respective package.

     After the successful installation, the build tree can be deleted. Note,
     however, that the Makefile-based deinstallation of the package requires
     the build tree to be present. To save disk space, the intermediate
     object files and built executables should still be deleted by

       $ make clean


  Makefile-based Deinstallation
  -----------------------------

  In order to undo the installation of the package files built from the sources,
  run the following command in the root directory of the build tree which was
  used to install the package

    $ cd ~/$pkg-build
    $ make uninstall
