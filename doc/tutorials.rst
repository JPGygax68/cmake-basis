The :ref:`BASIS Tutorials <Tutorials>` and :ref:`Quick Start Guides <QuickStartGuides>`
are a good start to get familiar with BASIS and its use. While the tutorials give more
in-depth information and references to :doc:`standard`, the quick start guides focus
on getting you started as quickly as possible without all the details. Therefore, it is
recommended to first have a look at the quick start guides and, if questions remain,
to follow the corresponding tutorial.

.. The ref links below are required for the LaTeX/PDF version as the download directive
   in this case does not translate to a hyperlink, but text only.
