.. _History:

History
========

The **Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS)** project was
started early in 2011 to improve and standardize the software packages
developed at the University of Pennsylvania's SBIA_. It started with the decision 
to use CMake_ as a build system, then the implementation of a project creation template.
Over time, these components were transformed to important parts of BASIS.
