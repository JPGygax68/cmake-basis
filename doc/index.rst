.. _QuickStartGuides:

Quick Start Guides
==================

Use the quick start guide to familiarize yourself with BASIS and get started as quickly as possible.
Then when you are ready for more detail you can try out the :ref:`Tutorials`.

1. :download:`Getting Started <tutorials/BASIS Quick Start Guide - 01 Getting Started.pptx>`
   (`ref <http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/_downloads/BASIS%20Quick%20Start%20Guide%20-%2001%20Getting%20Started.pptx>`__)


.. _Tutorials:

Tutorials
=========

The tutorial slides linked here for download give a slide-by-slide introduction to BASIS and
its use including in-depth information and references to further documentation. For a less
comprehensive tutorial-like introduction, please refer to the :ref:`QuickStartGuides`.

1. download :download:`Getting Started <tutorials/BASIS Tutorial - 01 Getting Started.pptx>`
   (`ref <http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/_downloads/BASIS%20Tutorial%20-%2001%20Getting%20Started.pptx>`__)
3. download :download:`BASIS Introduction <BASIS_Introduction.pptx>` for an explanation of the components and purpose of BASIS (`ref <http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/_downloads/BASIS_Introduction.pptx>`__).

.. The ref link is required for the PDF version as the download directive in
   this case does not translate to a hyperlink, but text only.


.. _HowToGuides:

How-to Guides
=============

The how-to guides explain the basics of following the :ref:`Standards <Standards>`, 
and explain common tasks like creating a new project or installation.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    howto/create-and-modify-project
    howto/manage-data
    howto/document
    howto/branch-and-release
    howto/package
    howto/install
    howto/run-automated-tests
    howto/template-customization


.. _APIDocumentation:

API Documentation
=================

The `API documentation <http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/basis/apidoc/latest/>`_
is generated from in-source comments using Doxygen_ and the filters provided by BASIS
for languages other than C++.

.. _Dependencies:

Dependencies
============

- CMake_ is required
- BASIS does the hard work of integrating many 3rd party libraries and tools for you,
  so of course they need to be installed for you to use them!
- Projects that use the BASIS CMake Modules will depend on BASIS to compile.
   - That means BASIS will either need to be installed on the system for your 
package to build, or the first steps in your build can be to compile and
install BASIS internally as part of a superbuild.
- Projects that use the BASIS C++ command line parsing and execution libraries
will also require a BASIS installation to be able to run.

.. _History:

History
========

The **Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS)** project was
started early in 2011 to improve and standardize the software packages
developed at the University of Pennsylvania's SBIA_. They started with the decision 
to use CMake_ as their build system, then implemented a project creation template.
Over time, these components were transformed to important parts of BASIS.
