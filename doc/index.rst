.. _Dependencies:

Dependencies
============

- CMake_ is required
- BASIS does the hard work of integrating many 3rd party libraries and tools for you,
  so of course they need to be installed for you to use them!
- Projects that use the BASIS CMake Modules will depend on BASIS to compile.
   - That means BASIS will either need to be installed on the system for your 
package to build, or the first steps in your build can be to compile and
install BASIS internally as part of a superbuild.
- Projects that use the BASIS C++ command line parsing and execution libraries
will also require a BASIS installation to be able to run.

.. _History:

History
========

The **Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS)** project was
started early in 2011 to improve and standardize the software packages
developed at the University of Pennsylvania's SBIA_. They started with the decision 
to use CMake_ as their build system, then implemented a project creation template.
Over time, these components were transformed to important parts of BASIS.
