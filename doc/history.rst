History
=======

The BASIS project was started early in 2011 to improve and standardize the software
packages developed at the `Section of Biomedical Image Analysis (SBIA) <http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/>`__
of the `University of Pennsylvania <http://www.upenn.edu/>`__. It started with the decision 
to use CMake_ as a build system which has been greatly extended using custom CMake
macros and functions and the implementation of a standardized project template. Over time,
these components were transformed to important parts of the CMake BASIS package.
