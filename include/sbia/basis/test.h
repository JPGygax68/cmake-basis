/*!
 * \file  test.h
 * \brief Main include file of BASIS C++ unit testing.
 *
 * This file should be included by implementations of unit tests.
 * Note that currently, we are simply using Google Test and Google Mock.
 * Likely, this will not change in the future. However, to be prepared,
 * we use this header file. The implementation of the functions and macros
 * provided by the underlying testing frameworks could then potentially
 * be replaced by own implementations.
